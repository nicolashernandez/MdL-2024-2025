However, it is challenging to align these models with human preferences. Therefore, the direct preference optimization (DPO) method comes in place which directly optimizes LLMs based models on user preferences, enhancing their alignment with human expectations. In this hands-on lab, you'll use the transformer reinforcement learning (trl) library from Hugging Face to implement DPO and fine-tune LLMs.\n",

Focus on improving your skills gradually.\\n4. Use a variety of tools and mediums: Experiment with different tools like pencils, pens, markers, and different mediums like paper, canvas, or digital apps to keep your drawing practice interesting and engaging.\\n5. Take breaks and rest: Taking breaks and resting after some time of drawing can help you avoid burnout and stay motivated.\\n6. Challenge yourself: Set challenges like drawing objects from memory or a specific subject to improve your skills and keep your drawing practice interesting.\\n7. Track your progress: Keep a record of your daily drawing practice and track your progress. This can be a source of motivation and help you see how far you've come.\\n\\nRemember, developing a habit takes time and patience.

Here are some strategies to help you develop the habit of drawing daily:\\n\\n1. Set a specific time: Allocate a specific time of the day to draw. It could be in the morning, afternoon, or evening. Make drawing a part of your daily routine.\\n2. Set a specific duration: Determine the amount of time you want to spend on drawing each day. It can be as little as 10 minutes or as long as an hour. Be consistent with the duration to help build the habit.\\n3. Start small and simple: Don't try to create a masterpiece every day, start with simple and easy-to-do sketches. Focus on improving your skills gradually.\\n4. Use a variety of tools and mediums: Experiment with different tools like pencils, pens, markers, and different mediums like paper, canvas, or digital apps to keep your drawing practice interesting and engaging.\\n5. Take breaks and rest: Taking breaks and resting after some time of drawing can help you avoid burnout and stay motivated.\\n6. Challenge yourself: Set challenges like drawing objects from memory or a specific subject to improve your skills and keep your drawing practice interesting.\\n7. Track your progress: Keep a record of your daily drawing practice and track your progress. This can be a source of motivation and help you see how far you've come.\\n\\nRemember, developing a habit takes time and patience. Stay consistent with your drawing practice, be flexible and open to trying new things, and with time, you'll develop a habit of daily drawing that brings you joy and satisfaction.\",\n",
              " 'rejected': \"One way to develop a habit of drawing daily is to allocate a specific time interval for drawing each day, whether it's early in the morning or before going to bed at night. You can also find inspiration or motivation to draw by joining drawing communities, following artists on social media, or going out into nature and sketching what you see. Additionally, practicing drawing every day can help you improve your skills over time.\"}"
